VIn probability theory and statistics, the Gumbel distribution (Generalized Extreme Value distribution Type-I) is used to model the distribution of the maximum (or the minimum) of a number of samples of various distributions. This distribution might be used to represent the distribution of the maximum level of a river in a particular year if there was a list of maximum values for the past ten years. It is useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur. The potential applicability of the Gumbel distribution to represent the distribution of maxima relates to extreme value theory, which indicates that it is likely to be useful if the distribution of the underlying sample data is of the normal or exponential type. The rest of this article refers to the Gumbel to model the distribution of the maximum value. To model the minimum value, use the negative of the original values.\u000aThe Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the generalized extreme value distribution (also known as the Fisher-Tippett distribution). It is also known as the log-Weibull distribution and the double exponential distribution (a term that is alternatively sometimes used to refer to the Laplace distribution). It is related to the Gompertz distribution: when its density is first reflected about the origin and then restricted to the positive half line, a Gompertz function is obtained.\u000aIn the latent variable formulation of the multinomial logit model \u2014 common in discrete choice theory \u2014 the errors of the latent variables follow a Gumbel distribution. This is useful because the difference of two Gumbel-distributed random variables has a logistic distribution.\u000aThe Gumbel distribution is named after Emil Julius Gumbel (1891\u20131966), based on his original papers describing the distribution.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Properties ==\u000aThe cumulative distribution function of the Gumbel distribution is\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        F\u000a        (\u000a        x\u000a        ;\u000a        \u03bc\u000a        ,\u000a        \u03b2\u000a        )\u000a        =\u000a        \u000a          e\u000a          \u000a            \u2212\u000a            \u000a              e\u000a              \u000a                \u2212\u000a                (\u000a                x\u000a                \u2212\u000a                \u03bc\u000a                )\u000a                \u000a                  /\u000a                \u000a                \u03b2\u000a              \u000a            \u000a          \u000a        \u000a        .\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle F(x;\u005cmu ,\u005cbeta )=e^{-e^{-(x-\u005cmu )/\u005cbeta }}.\u005c,}\u000a  \u000aThe mode is \u03bc, while the median is \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u03bc\u000a        \u2212\u000a        \u03b2\u000a        ln\u000a        \u2061\u000a        \u000a          (\u000a          \u000a            ln\u000a            \u2061\u000a            2\u000a          \u000a          )\u000a        \u000a        ,\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005cmu -\u005cbeta \u005cln \u005cleft(\u005cln 2\u005cright),}\u000a   and the mean is given by\u000a\u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        E\u000a        \u2061\u000a        (\u000a        X\u000a        )\u000a        =\u000a        \u03bc\u000a        +\u000a        \u03b3\u000a        \u03b2\u000a        ,\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005coperatorname {E} (X)=\u005cmu +\u005cgamma \u005cbeta ,}\u000a  \u000awhere \u000a  \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u03b3\u000a        \u2248\u000a        0.5772\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    {\u005cdisplaystyle \u005cgamma \u005capprox 0.5772}\u000a   is the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant.

Therefore, this estimator is often used as a plotting position.\u000aThe blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Gumbel distribution to ranked maximum one-day October rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence band based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by the plotting position r/(n+1) as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.\u000aIn number theory, the Gumbel distribution approximates the number of terms in a random partition of an integer as well as the trend-adjusted sizes of maximal prime gaps and maximal gaps between prime constellations.\u000aIn machine learning, the Gumbel distribution is sometimes employed to generate samples from the categorical distribution for example.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aType-1 Gumbel distribution\u000aType-2 Gumbel distribution\u000aExtreme value theory\u000aGeneralized extreme value distribution\u000aFisher\u2013Tippett\u2013Gnedenko theorem\u000aEmil Julius Gumbel\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==

In December 2009, the district administration reported that 457 pupils or 10.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services.\u000aIn order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department.\u000aIn 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.\u000aThe Plum Borough School District received a $2,221,361 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Gifted education ===\u000aThe District Administration reported that 185 or 4.29% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Budget ==\u000aPennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1.\u000aUnder Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days' public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.\u000aIn 2013, the school board furloughed three teachers and a guidance counselor, and eliminated the Family and Consumer Science program at the high school. During the budget setting process, many electives that had been cut, in an attempt to close a $1.5 million deficit. Those electives were restored in the final budget. The Board will utilize $950,422 from the budgetary reserves in order to balance the budget. This builds in a deficit for the next school year which will be compounded by the teacher pension costs increase.\u000aIn 2011, the average teacher salary in Plum Borough School District was $70,694.69 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $18,412.81 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $89,107.50. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers' total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security.\u000aIn 2009, Plum Borough School District reported employing 397 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $69,326 and a top salary of $125,000. The teacher's work day is 7 hours 30 minutes with 188 days in the contract year (180 days of instruction). Teachers receive a thirty-minute duty-free lunch and daily preparation period.

Upon retirement teachers receive compensation for all unused sick and personal days.\u000aIn 2007, the average teacher salary in the district was $63,233 for 180 days worked. The district ranked sixth in Allegheny County for average teacher salary in 2007. The average teacher salary in Pennsylvania was $54,977. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, personal days, sick days, and other benefits.\u000aPer pupil spending The Plum Borough School District's administrative costs per pupil in 2008 were $648 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association keeps statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association, the average salary for a superintendent for the 2007-08 school year was $122,165. In 2008, Dr. Lillian Naccarati, Superintendent, received $119,802. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. Superintendent, Dr. Lillian Naccarati's salary was $125,000 in 2009. In the fall of 2011, the District spent $220,406 on an agreement that prematurely terminated the Superintendent's employment. The School Board then promoted assistant superintendent, Dr. Timothy Glasspool to Superintendent awarding him a four-year contract. He will be paid $130,000 per year, plus an extensive benefits package. According to Plum School Board President Kevin Dowdell, no one else was considered for the position.\u000aReserves In 2010, Plum Borough Administration reported $6,230,502.00 in the District's unreserved-undesignated fund. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories \u2013 designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds. In 2008, the district reported a balance of zero in its unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as increasing to $7,291,318.  In 2006-07, the district reported $6,006,093 in its unreserved-undesignated fund.\u000aAudit In August 2011, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the Plum Borough School District. Multiple significant findings were reported to the School Board and the District's administration. In April 2013, the District was audited again by the Pennsylvania Auditor General's office. They found the District Administration had failed to take recommended actions to address problems in last audit. Additional findings were reported to the administration and school board. This included "Our prior audit found that on April 29, 2008, the board approved a Memorandum of Understanding between the PBSD and the Superintendent in which the PBSD accepted the Superintendent's "irrevocable retirement" effective June 30, 2008. The retirement occurred one year prior to the end of the Superintendent's employment contract and resulted in costs to the PBSD of $220,406." \u000aPlum Borough School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 0.5%, Per Capita Tax (Act 511 and School Code) at $10.00, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, Local Service Tax - $5.00 a year and grants, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the District. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== State basic education funding ===\u000aFor the 2013-14 school year, the Plum Borough School District will receive a 2.3% increase or $12,539,153 in Pennsylvania Basic Education Funding. This is $30,537 more than its 2012-13 state BEF to the District. Additionally, Plum Borough School District will receive $21,713 in Accountability Block Grant funding to focus on academic achievement and level funding for special education services. Among the public school districts in Allegheny County, South Fayette Township School District received the highest percentage increase at 5,5%. The District has the option of applying for several other state and federal grants to increase revenues. The Commonwealth's budget increased Basic Education Funding statewide by $123 million to over $5.5 billion. Most of Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts received an increase of Basic Education Funding in a range of 0.9% to 4%. Eight public school districts received exceptionally high funding increases of 10% to 16%. The highest increase in state funding was awarded to Austin Area School District which received a 22.5% increase in Basic Education Funding. The state funded the PSERS (Pennsylvania school employee pension fund) with $1,017,000,000 and Social Security payments for school employees of $495 million.\u000aFor the 2012-13 school year, the Plum Borough School District received $12,482,523 in state Basic Education Funding. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012-2013 includes $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which is an increase of $49 million over the 2011-12 budget. The state also provides $100 million for the Accountability Block grant. Plum Borough School District received $21,713 in Accountability Block Grant funding to focus on academic achievement. The state will also provide $544.4 million for School Employees' Social Security and $856 million for School Employees' Retirement fund called PSERS. This amount is a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011-2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, School Employees' Social Security, Pupil Transportation, Nonpublic and Charter School Pupil Transportation. Since taking office, Corbett's first two budgets have restored more than $918 million in support of public schools, compensating for the $1 billion in federal stimulus dollars lost at the end of the 2010-11 school year.\u000aIn 2011-12, Plum Borough School District received a $12,260,785, allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $221,738 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation.

In 2010, the district reported that 724 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.\u000aIn the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $12,825,603. Among the districts in Allegheny County, the highest increase went to South Fayette Township School District which got an 11.32% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some public school districts at a far greater rate than others.\u000aIn the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2.56% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $12,574,121.

This amount increased up to $12,085 by the year 2008.\u000aThe state Basic Education Funding to Plum Borough School District in 2008-09 was $11,553,744.01.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Accountability Block Grants ====\u000aBeginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $601,852 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for the seventh year.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Classrooms for the Future grant ====\u000aThe Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Plum Borough School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the District received $480,074. The District received $87,594 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $567,668. In County the highest award was given to Highlands School District which received $835,286. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Other grants ====\u000aPlum Borough School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants, PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell), Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== STEAM grant ===\u000aIn 2013, Plum Borough School District received a $20,000 grant from the Claude Worthington Benedum and Grable foundations. The STEAM funds are to be used to support science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics programs. The curriculum is to involve students in kindergarten through fifth grade. School administration were required to apply for the grants. Recipients include 24 schools located in: Allegheny County, Beaver County, Butler County, Fayette County, Greene County, Lawrence County, Mercer County, Washington County and Westmoreland County.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Federal Stimulus grant ===\u000aPlum Borough School District received an extra $2,312,443 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Race to the Top grant ====\u000aPlum Borough School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district over one million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved in the first round of the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. A second round of state RTTT application judging will occur in June 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Real estate taxes ===\u000aProperty tax rates in 2013-14 were set by the Plum Borough School Board at 18.75 mills. The rate included a downward adjustment due to the County's recent property reassessment. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.\u000a2012-13 - 22.2000 mills\u000a2010-11 - 22.2000 mills \u000a2009-10 - 22.2000 mills.\u000a2008-09 - 22.2000 mills.\u000a2007-08 - 22.2000 mills.\u000a2006-07 - 22.2000 mills.\u000a2005-06 - 21.2000 mills.\u000aThe average yearly property tax paid by Allegheny County residents amounts to about 4.09% of their yearly income. Allegheny County ranked 209th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income. According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Act 1 Adjusted Index ====\u000aThe Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.\u000aIn June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.\u000aA specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\u000aThe School District Adjusted Index for the Plum Borough School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012.\u000a\u000aFor the 2013-14 budget year, Plum Borough School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed their Act 1 Index limit. For the school budget year 2013-14, 311 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index. Another 171 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 89 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed their tax limit. For the pension costs exception, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. Eleven Pennsylvania public school districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.\u000aFor the 2012-13 budget year, Plum Borough School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.\u000aFor the 2011-12 school year, Plum Borough School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Plum Borough School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\u000aAccording to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Consolidation ==\u000aA proposal has been made by David Wassell, a prominent resident and leader in Allegheny County, to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars, focus dollars on student achievement, and improve student services. The plan calls for a proposed district that includes: Plum Borough School District and Riverview School District.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Wellness policy ==\u000aPlum Borough School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) "shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006."\u000aThe legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Highmark Healthy High 5 grants ===\u000aIn 2009, four Plum Borough School District schools received extra funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Adlai Stevenson School received $4,500 which was used to support physical education activities that will develop teamwork and improved physical fitness for grades K-6. Holiday Park Elementary received $9,500 which was used to support the "Stepping Up to Fitness" pedometer program for students in grades K-6. Oblock Junior High School received $9,908 for heart rate monitors for 7th and 8th grade PE classes. Plum Senior High School received $9,800 which was used for aerobic and resistance training equipment and pedometers for 9th grade students' Physical Education classes. In 2011, 3 Plum School District Schools received grants - Pivik Elementary School and Regency Park Elementary School got $9,534. Adlai Stevenson received $10,000 for a fitness for life program. Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Extracurriculars ==\u000aThe students have access to a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. Plum Borough School District's football classification is "AAAA" (Quad-A), which is the largest of the football classifications A, AA, AAA and AAAA.\u000aBy Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private non-public school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.\u000aThe district operates a chapter of the National Honor Society.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Athletics ===\u000aThe district offers an extensive program funded by the local and state taxpayers.

aVThe Ledger Awards are prizes awarded to "acknowledge excellence in Australian comic art and publishing." Named after pioneering Australian cartoonist Peter Ledger (1945\u20131994), the awards were first held in 2005 to help promote and focus attention on Australian creators and their projects, both in Australia and overseas. Initially, the awards were held annually and announced online on or around Australia Day, 26 January. In recent years, they have been held at the State Library of Victoria on the Friday evening before the Melbourne Supanova convention.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe Ledger Awards began in 2004 as a fully independent, non-profit initiative. They were presented under the auspices of LitterArtsy, a non-profit coalition of creators, publishers and web sites promoting literacy, creativity, craft and excellence through comics and sequential art, and had no affiliations or links with organisations, businesses, or other parties.\u000aThe Ledger Awards were presented annually until 2007, when they went on hiatus.

aVAnthony John Hardy (born 31 May 1951) is an English serial killer who is known as the Camden Ripper for dismembering some of his victims. In November 2003, he was sentenced to three life terms for three murders, but he may have killed up to nine people.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aBorn in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England, Hardy had an apparently uneventful childhood and excelled in school and college. He earned an engineer's degree from Imperial College London and subsequently became a manager of a large company. Hardy married and fathered three sons and one daughter; his wife divorced him in 1986, accusing him of domestic violence. In 1982, Hardy was arrested in Tasmania for trying to drown his wife, but the charges were later dropped.\u000aAfter the divorce, Hardy spent time in mental hospitals, diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He lived in various hostels in London, picking up convictions for theft and being drunk and disorderly. He was arrested in 1998 when a prostitute accused him of raping her, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. He became an alcoholic and diabetic.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Murders ==\u000aIn January 2002, police were called to the block of flats where Hardy lived after a neighbour complained that someone had vandalised her front door and that she strongly suspected Hardy. When the police investigated Hardy's flat, they found a locked door and, despite his claims to the contrary, found that Hardy had a key. In the room the police found the naked dead body of a woman lying on a bed with cuts and bruises to her head. She was identified as Sally White, 38, a prostitute who had been living in London.\u000aForensic pathologist Freddy Patel subsequently concluded that White had died of a heart attack, in spite of the circumstances. Patel later came under scrutiny for this and other findings in his career, including the 2009 death of Ian Tomlinson, resulting in a suspension from the government's register of pathologists pending an inquiry. In 2012, his name was erased from the medical register by the General Medical Council, meaning that he can no longer practise medicine in the United Kingdom.\u000aHardy pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal damage and claimed he had no knowledge of how White came to be in his flat due to his drinking problem. Whilst in custody Hardy was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983, remaining there until November 2002.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Arrest and trial ==\u000aOn 30 December 2002, a homeless man scavenging for food in bins found some of the dismembered remains of two women, stuffed into bin-liners. The victims were identified as Bridgette MacClennan, 34, and Elizabeth Valad, 29. The investigation led to Hardy, who was arrested a week later. He had gone on the run, but was spotted by an off-duty policeman when he went to Great Ormond Street Hospital to collect his prescription for insulin. During a search of the grounds of the hospital, Hardy was found hiding behind bins. A fight took place as he resisted arrest, during the course of which a police officer was knocked unconscious and another officer was stabbed through the hand and had his eye socket dislocated. Despite suffering these injuries, the wounded police officer held Hardy until backup arrived and he was arrested at the scene. A subsequent search of his flat found evidence, including old blood stains, indicating the two women had been killed and dismembered there. Both had died over the Christmas holidays.\u000aUnder arrest, Hardy simply replied "no comment" to every question put to him by police. He was eventually charged with the murders of both MacClennan and Valad, and of White, the woman whose death had originally been put down to natural causes. At his trial in November 2003 Hardy, despite his initial lack of cooperation with the police, abruptly changed his plea to guilty to all three counts of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Because of Hardy's history of psychiatric problems and violent behaviour, an independent enquiry was announced into his care.\u000aIt has been reported that police believe Hardy is possibly connected to the unsolved cases of two prostitutes found dismembered and dumped in the River Thames, and up to five or six other murders that bore marked similarities to the ones for which he was convicted, but where not enough evidence is available directly implicating him.\u000aHardy has been diagnosed with a personality disorder. In May 2010, a High Court judge decided that Hardy should never be released from prison, placing him on the list of whole life tariff prisoners. Mr Justice Keith, sitting in London, said: "This is one of those exceptionally rare cases in which life should mean life."\u000a\u000a\u000a== In popular culture ==\u000aHardy was the subject of an episode of Evil Up Close on the Crime and Investigation Network, focusing on the 2010 decision to keep Hardy in prison for the rest of his life. The film was directed by Robert Murray and written and produced by Will Hanrahan. After Hardy was imprisoned British rap artist Plan B released a song about Hardy, dubbing him the 'Camden Ripper'. Hardy is also mentioned, and his flat pointed out, in the music video "Guided tour of Camden" by Charlie Sloth. Hardy was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, The Hunt for the Camden Ripper, broadcast in 2004. It was narrated by Juliet Stevenson and directed by Olly Lambert.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==

aVIn politics, the term base refers to a group of voters who almost always support a single party's candidates for elected office. Base voters are very unlikely to vote for the candidate of an opposing party, regardless of the specific views each candidate holds. In the United States, this is typically because high-level candidates must hold the same stances on key issues as a party's base in order to gain the party's nomination and thus be guaranteed ballot access. In the case of legislative elections, base voters often prefer to support their party's candidate against an otherwise appealing opponent in order to strengthen their party's chances of gaining a simple majority; typically the gateway to overarching power in a legislature.

aVJeanette Eaton (November 30, 1886 \u2013 February 19, 1968) was an American writer of children's books, primarily biography and history. Four times she was one of the runners-up for the annual Newbery Medal. She was a suffragist and feminist.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000aEaton was born in Columbus, Ohio. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Vassar College in 1908 and a Master of Arts degree from Ohio State University in 1910.\u000aEaton was a supporter of women's rights since at least her college years, giving her first public suffragist speech soon after she finished college. In 1915 she co-authored, along with Bertha Morton Stevens, Commercial Work and Training for Girls, which examined the harsh working conditions of women for that time period. In an article in Harper's Weekly in August 1915 she argued that modern inventions, such as electricity, washing machines, and typewriters, were the "best friend" of women, not suffrage nor education. She also wrote at least one article for The Masses, a periodical published from 1911\u20131917 which had socialist, feminist, and free-love writings. By the late 1920s, she was becoming a recognized writer. She was also an editor for the children's magazine Story Parade. She continued writing for feminist periodicals such as AWA [American Woman's Association] Bulletin and Woman's Journal. Her strong feminist views were readily apparent in a November 1915 article she wrote for The Masses:\u000a\u000a"The woman's magazine is the savior of society, man's best friend, the final hope of our chivalric civilization. Woman's ambitions, her independence, the assertion of her own free personality are gradually but certainly inhibited by a few years of such reading".\u000a\u000aHer writing, which included many biographies for young adults, has sometimes been thought "melodramatic" and to have "bordered on the overblown", but her biography of Mohandas Gandhi, Gandhi, Fighter Without a Sword (1950, a 1951 Newbery Honor book) "was written in a more muted and understated style". She was given the 1959 Ohioana Award for her 1958 young adult biography of Mark Twain, America's Own Mark Twain.\u000aShe died in Central Valley, New York.

aVNeno Belan is a Croatian rock musician, known as the frontman of \u0110avoli, as well as for his solo work.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Biography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early career ===\u000aNeno Belan started his career as a teenager in the band Losos, Kavijar i Marsovi Bizoni (Salmon, Caviar and Bisons from Mars). In 1980 he became a member of the band Narodno Blago (National Treasure) which performed rhythm and blues and occasionally performed as the supporting band for Split punk rock musician Fon Bi\u0161ki\u0107, with whom they performed covers of The Rolling Stones, Ramones and The Clash songs. Narodno Blago disbanded in 1983, and Belan became the member of the band Aquilla. The band performed Dalmatian folk songs, and Belan played mandolin.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== \u0110avoli and solo career ===\u000a\u000aIn 1984 Belan formed the band \u0110avoli (The Devils), which performed music inspired by 1950s rock and roll. The band successfully performed until 1991. In 1991 appeared Belan's first solo release, EP Rock galama (Rock Noise), recorded with the members of \u0110avoli. In 1991 \u0110avoli disbanded due to the outbreak of Yugoslav wars, and 1991 Split Festival, where Belan and Anja \u0160ovagi\u0107 Despot were scheduled to perform the song "Ljubav postoji zbog nas", was canceled. Belan appeared on the Split Festival in 1992 performing song "Zaboravi". In 1993 he released his first solo album, Vino no\u0107i (Night Wine). The album vas recorded with members of Daleka Obala. Vino no\u0107i featured hits "Zaboravi", "Sun\u010dan dan" (written by Zdravko Bajan, a former member of Narodno Blago), "A gdje si ti?" and "Ljubav postoji zbog nas" (previously unreleased duet with Anja \u0160ovagi\u0107 Despot). The album also featured English language versions of "Vino no\u0107i" and "Sun\u010dan dan". In 1994 he released EP Mama, and the title track was a candidate for the Croatian representative at the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest. The EP also featured songs "Beat na moru" (a cover of the 1960s Delfini hit) and "Ne pitaj za nju" (a duet with Toni Cetinski).\u000aDuring the 1990s, Belan performed mostly abroad, while in Croatia he appeared mostly at music festivals. In 1995 He released pop-oriented album Dolazi ljubav (Love Is Coming). On the tour that followed the album release he was followed by the bass guitarist Olja De\u0161i\u0107 and the drummer Leo Rumora. In 1997 he released the album Ju\u017enja\u010dka utjeha (Southern Comfort). The album featured a cover of The Vibrators' "Baby Baby" (Belan's version entitled "Lezi, baby") and a cover of Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind" (Belan's version entitled "Odgovor u vjetru").\u000aIn 1998 Belan reunited \u0110avoli when Vedran Kri\u017ean joined the band as the keyboardist, thus finished the gathering of the group, soon to be known as "Fiumens", but not before they tried to revive old "\u0110avoli" brand so the band released the album Space Twist. However, \u0110avoli disbanded once again, and Neno, Olja, Leo and Vedran formed the band Neno Belan & Fiumens, and they released albums Luna & Stelle in 2002 and Rijeka snova (The River of Dreams) in 2007 as Neno Belan & Fiumens, as well as "Dream factory" in 2009, double CD, live from "Tvornica" (factory), for which they got many discography awards in Croatia (PORIN).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Discography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== \u0110avoli ===\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Studio albums ====\u000aLjubav i moda (1986)\u000aHallo Lulu 22 (1987)\u000aOstani uz mene (1988)\u000aSpace Twist (1998)\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Compilations ====\u000aBalade \u2013 Kad se na\u0111em u predjelu no\u0107i...

aVHydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), also known as niacin receptor 1 (NIACR1) and GPR109A, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the HCAR2 gene.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Function ==\u000aHCA2 is a high-affinity Gi/Go-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for nicotinic acid (niacin), and is a member of the nicotinic acid receptor family of GPCRs. HCA2 activation inhibits lipolytic and atherogenic activity (i.e., it inhibits the breakdown of fats and the development of atherosclerosis), induces vasodilation (i.e., the dilation of blood vessels), and is responsible for niacin-induced flushing.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 5-oxo-ETE ===\u000aThe mouse ortholog of HCA2, Niacr1, has been proposed to mediate the ability of 5-oxo-ETE, a member of the 5-HETE family of eicosanoids, to stimulate the production of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mRNA, Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and thereby progesterone in mouse cultured MA-10 Leydig cells. Human tissues respond to 5-oxo-ETE and other 5-HETE family members though the OXER1 G protein-coupled receptor. The roles, if any, of Niacr1 in the response of leydig cells to other 5-HETE family members, of Niacr1 in the response of other mouse cells to 5-HETE family members, and the role of HCA2 in the response of human tissues to 5-HETE family members has not been determined.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Clinical significance ==\u000aHCA2 is an important biomolecular target of niacin which is a widely prescribed drug for the treatment of dyslipidemia and to increase HDL cholesterol but whose therapeutic use is limited by flushing. In HCA2 knockout mice, the effects of niacin on both lipids and flushing is eliminated. Furthermore, in arrestin beta 1 knockout mice, niacin's effect on flushing is greatly reduced while the lipid modifying effects are maintained. At high doses, niacin produces marked anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of tissues \u2013 including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and vascular tissue \u2013 through activation of HCA2. Niacin has also been shown to attenuate neuroinflammation in part through NIACR1 binding; consequently, HCA2 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for treating neuroimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.\u000aThe precise mechanism of action of niacin therapeutic effects has not been fully elucidated, but appears to work in part through activation of HCA2 which reduces the levels of intracellular cAMP thereby inhibiting lipolysis in adipocytes. In contrast, the flushing effect is due to HCA2 activation of ERK 1/2 MAP kinase mediated by arrestin beta 1. Activation of MAP kinase in turn causes release of prostaglandin D2 from Langerhans cells in the skin.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ligands ==\u000aFull agonists of HCA2 include:\u000aNiacin (also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid)\u000aButyric acid and butyrate\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aVArnold Heyworth Beckett (12 February 1920 \u2013 25 January 2010) was a British pharmacist, academic, and expert on doping in sport.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aBeckett was born on 12 February 1920 in The Fylde, Lancashire, England. He was educated at Baines School, then a grammar school in Poulton-le-Fylde. He studied at the School of Pharmacy and Birkbeck College, both part of the University of London. He completed his Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in 1947 and his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1950. He took, but failed, the Civil Service entrance examination.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Career ==\u000aBeckett rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s when steroid use amongst athletes was banned from certain competitions. He participated in several high profile investigations such as Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson who was ultimately stripped of his Olympic gold medal for testing positive for the drugs in 1988. After controversial rulings were delivered following the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Beckett resigned from the medical commission and ultimately became an advocate for athletes accused of doping.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Honours ==\u000aIn July 1976, Beckett was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (DSC) degree by Heriot-Watt University.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

aV"This Woman And This Man" is a song written by Jeff Pennig and Michael Lunn, and recorded by American country music singer Clay Walker. It was released in January 1995 as the second single from his album If I Could Make a Living. The song reached the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000aWalker told The Dallas Morning News, "I felt this song speaks to the listener, it definitely spoke to me. I've lived that song as well as everybody else who has been in love before."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reception ==\u000aLarry Flick of Billboard gave the song a positive review writing "Walker has never sounded better than he does on this midtempo tale of a frustrating relationship. It is nice to see that even with all his success Walker intends to grow into that hat." Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote, Not only is it the best vocal performance by Mr. Walker thus far, it's the classiest piece of music he's ever recorded. Mario Tarradell later wrote, "This Woman and This Man, his biggest chart single yet, is a smooth, melodic ballad with a new twist on the age-old struggle to keep an ailing relationship beating."\u000aKevin John Coyne of Country Universe listed "This Woman and This Man" as the 147th best country single of the 1990s and wrote, "Against a pleading melody, Walker sings of a man who's trying desperately to make his other half understand that there's still a chance to save their relationship. That he feels the only way he can communicate this is by stripping the situation down to an anonymous woman and man is heartbreaking."\u000a\u000a\u000a== Music video ==\u000aThere was a music video for this song, directed by Bill Young. It shows Walker and his lover at a meeting. There, his lover is seeming to forget about him. He eventually leaves angry at her. Then his lover goes after him, and she comforts him. It also shows Walker in an old black and white theme with a woman and a man.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Charts ==\u000a"This Woman and This Man" debuted at number 53 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of January 14, 1995.

aVThe arts refers to the theory and physical expression of creativity found in human societies and cultures. Major constituents of the arts include literature \u2013 including poetry, prose and drama, performing arts \u2013 among them music, dance, and theatre; and visual arts \u2013 including drawing, painting, photography, ceramics, sculpting, and architecture \u2013 the art of designing and constructing buildings.\u000aSome art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. cinematography) or artwork with the written word (e.g. comics). From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Definitions ==\u000aIn its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is "good" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. Merriam-Webster defines "the arts" as "painting, sculpture, music, theater, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination." Similarly, the United States Congress, in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined "the arts" as follows:\u000a\u000aThe term 'the arts' includes, but is not limited to, music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, architecture and allied fields, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic and craft arts, industrial design, costume and fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, film, video, tape and sound recording, the arts related to the presentation, performance, execution, and exhibition of such major art forms, all those traditional arts practiced by the diverse peoples of this country. (sic) and the study and application of the arts to the human environment.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aIn Ancient Greece, all art and craft was referred to by the same word, techne. Thus, there was no distinction between the arts. Ancient Greek art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. Ancient Roman art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. Zeus' thunderbolt). In Byzantine and Gothic art of the Middle Ages, the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan. Religious Islamic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Classifications ===\u000a\u000aIn the Middle Ages, the Artes Liberales (liberal arts) were taught in universities as part of the Trivium, an introductory curriculum involving grammar, rhetoric, and logic, and of the Quadrivium, a curriculum involving the "mathematical arts" of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. The Artes Mechanicae (consisting of vestiaria \u2013 tailoring and weaving; agricultura \u2013 agriculture; architectura \u2013 architecture and masonry; militia and venatoria \u2013 warfare, hunting, military education, and the martial arts; mercatura \u2013 trade; coquinaria \u2013 cooking; and metallaria \u2013 blacksmithing and metallurgy) were practised and developed in guild environments. The modern distinction between "artistic" and "non-artistic" skills did not develop until the Renaissance. In modern academia, the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the humanities. Some subjects in the humanities are history, linguistics, literature, theology, philosophy, and logic.\u000aThe arts have also been classified as seven: Literature, painting, sculpture, and music comprise the main four arts, of which the other three are derivative; drama is literature with acting, dance is music expressed through motion, and song is music with literature and voice.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Visual arts ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Drawing ===\u000a\u000aDrawing is a means of making an image, using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax colour pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a drafter, draftswoman, or draughtsman. Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as illustrations, comics and animation.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Painting ===\u000a\u000aColour is the essence of painting as sound is of music. Colour is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including Goethe, Kandinsky, and Newton, have written their own colour theory. Moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a colour equivalent. The word "red," for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum. There is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as C or C#, although the Pantone system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose.\u000aModern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, for example, collage. This began with Cubism, and is not painting in the strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as sand, cement, straw, wood or strands of hair for their texture. Examples of this are the works of Elito Circa, Jean Dubuffet or Anselm Kiefer. Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of concept; this has led some to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work. Indigenouism is also considered as Modern and contemporary Art in early 20th Century.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ceramics ===\u000a\u000aCeramic art is art made from ceramic materials (including clay), which may take forms such as pottery, tile, figurines, sculpture, and tableware. While some ceramic products are considered fine art, some are considered to be decorative, industrial, or applied art objects. Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology.Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery." In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce studio pottery. In modern ceramic engineering usage, "ceramics" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Photography ===\u000a\u000aPhotography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism, which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Architecture ===\u000a\u000aArchitecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures. The word architecture comes from the Greek arkhitekton, "master builder, director of works," from \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9- (arkhi) "chief" + \u03c4\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd (tekton) "builder, carpenter". A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of town planning, urban design, and landscape architecture to the microlevel of creating furniture. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and cost for the builder, as well as function and aesthetics for the user.\u000a\u000aIn modern usage, architecture is the art and discipline of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or system. The term can be used to connote the implied architecture of abstract things such as music or mathematics, the apparent architecture of natural things, such as geological formations or the structure of biological cells, or explicitly planned architectures of human-made things such as software, computers, enterprises, and databases, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a subjective mapping from a human perspective (that of the user in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the elements or components of some kind of structure or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing aesthetics. This distinguishes it from applied science or engineering, which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.\u000aIn the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a hospital or a stadium, to the apparently simpler, such as planning residential houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political symbols, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Sculpture ===\u000a\u000aSculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials; but since modernism, shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded, or cast.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Conceptual art ===\u000a\u000aConceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the UK, developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practise the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Literary arts ==\u000a\u000aLiterature is literally "acquaintance with letters" as in the first sense given in the Oxford English Dictionary. The noun "literature" comes from the Latin word littera meaning "an individual written character (letter)." The term has generally come to identify a collection of writings, which in Western culture are mainly prose (both fiction and non-fiction), drama and poetry. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be oral as well, and include such genres as epic, legend, myth, ballad, other forms of oral poetry, and as folktale. Comics, the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the "ninth art" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Performing arts ==\u000a\u000aPerforming arts comprise dance, music, theatre, opera, mime, and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance. Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including actors, magicians, comedians, dancers, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as songwriting and stagecraft. Performers often adapt their appearance with tools such as costume and stage makeup.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Music ===\u000a\u000aMusic is an art form whose medium is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to aleatoric pieces. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within "the arts," music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and auditory art.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Theatre ===\u000a\u000aTheatre or theater (from Greek theatron (\u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd); from theasthai, "behold") is the branch of the performing arts concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle \u2013 indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as opera, ballet, mime, kabuki, classical Indian dance, Chinese opera and mummers' plays.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Dance ===\u000a\u000aDance (from Old French dancier, of unknown origin) generally refers to human movement either used as a form of expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (the leaves danced in the wind), and certain musical forms or genres. Choreography is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. People danced to relieve stress. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social, cultural, aesthetic, artistic and moral constraints and range from functional movement (such as Folk dance) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet. In sports, gymnastics, figure skating and synchronized swimming are dance disciplines while Martial arts "kata" are often compared to dances.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Multidisciplinary artistic works ==\u000a\u000aAreas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as film, opera and performance art. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for "works," because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional opera, the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music). The composer Richard Wagner recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ("The Ring of the Nibelung"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead Gesamtkunstwerk ("synthesis of the arts"), sometimes referred to as "Music Drama" in English, emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical ballet is another form which emerged in the 19th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.\u000aOther works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as performance art. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. John Cage is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition Living Room Music composed in 1940 is a "quartet" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other arts ==\u000aThere is no clear line between art and culture. Cultural fields like gastronomy are sometimes considered as arts.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Applied arts ===\u000a\u000aThe applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing. The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art. The term "applied art" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Video games ===\u000a\u000aA debate exists in the fine arts and video game cultures over whether video games can be counted as an art form. Game designer Hideo Kojima professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators \u2013 not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets.\u000aWithin social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.\u000aIn May 2011, the National Endowment of the Arts included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a "work of art" when applying of a grant. In 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum presented an exhibit, The Art of the Video Game. Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Arts criticism ==\u000aArchitecture criticism\u000aVisual art criticism\u000aDance criticism\u000aFilm criticism\u000aMusic criticism\u000aTelevision criticism\u000aTheatre criticism\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aFine art\u000aMartial arts\u000aArts education\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==
